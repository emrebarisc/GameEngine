# How to Run

- In order to be able to run the engine, you need to clone submodules as well.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/emrebarisc/GoknarEngine.git --recurse-submodules
  ```

- Cmake configurations are work in progress right now. Therefore the project can be built only in linux systems.
